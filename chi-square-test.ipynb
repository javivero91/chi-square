    "The **chi-square test for homogeneity**, sometimes referred to as an A/B test, is a way of determining whether two or more sub-groups of a population share the same distribution of a single categorical variable. For example, do people of different races have the same proportion of smokers to non-smokers? In contrast to the two-proportion z-test, used when the response variable has only two categories as outcomes and we are comparing two groups, the homogeneity test is used if the response variable has several outcome categories, and we wish to compare two or more groups."

    "\n",
    "To perform such a test, we will measure a categorical variable in different groups so we will end up with an $m\\times n$ contingency table, i.e. a table with $m$ rows and $n$ columns. This can be thought of as an $m\\times n$ matrix or as $2$-dimensional Python array of shape $(m,n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A homogeneity test is after all an instance of hypothesis testing, so we need to state a **null hypothesis** and an **alternative hypothesis**. Before we start we also need to set a significance level $\\alpha$. Statistical significance measures how likely it would be to observe what was observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true, so based on our chosen significance level and the value of the test statistic we can decide if we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test statistic is the **chi-square** which can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\chi^2_k = \\sum_{i,j}\\dfrac {(O_{i,j} - E_{i,j})^2} {E_{i,j}},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k=(\\text{number of rows}-1)\\times (\\text{number of columns} - 1)$ represents the degrees of freedom, $O_{i,j}$ the observed value in row $i$, column $j$ and $E_{i,j}$ the expected value of row $i$, column $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the expected value we use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{i,j} = \\dfrac{(\\text{sum of row}\\ i)\\times (\\text{sum of column}\\ j)} {\\text{sum of all entries}}.$$"

    "A food delivery start-up decides to advertise its service by placing ads on web pages. They wonder whether the percentage of viewers who click on the ad changes depending on how often the viewers were shown the ad. They randomly select 100 viewers from among those who were shown the add once, 135 from among those who were shown the add twice, and 150 from among those who were shown the ad three times.\n",

Our case concerns the distribution of the categorical variable \"clicked on ad\" in each of the three samples."
